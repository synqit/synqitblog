So you are new to Microsoft 365 — or maybe you are not new, but you have never created a user before.  
Good news: creating a new user in Microsoft 365 is actually very easy.

In this post I will guide you step by step through creating your first user in the Microsoft 365 Admin Portal.

## What do you need?
- A Microsoft 365 tenant (makes sense, right?)
- A Microsoft 365 account with the **User Administrator** role assigned  
  *(Global Administrator also works)*

Alright, let’s create that user.

## Step-by-step: creating a new user

### Step 1  
Go to **https://admin.microsoft.com** and sign in with your administrator account.

### Step 2  
In the left-hand menu, select **Users**, and then choose **Active users**.

### Step 3  
Just below the *Active users* heading, select **Add user**.

### Step 4  
Fill out the basic information:
- First name  
- Last name  
- Display name  
- Username  

Make sure you select the correct domain for the user from the dropdown list.

### Step 5  
Choose how the password should be created:
- Automatically generate a password, or  
- Set a password manually  

You can also choose whether the user must change their password at first sign-in.

### Step 6  
Select the correct **location** and assign a **product license**.  
You *can* continue without assigning a license, but this is usually not recommended.

### Step 7  
Under **Optional settings**, decide whether:
- The user should be a standard user, or  
- The user should receive an admin role

### Step 8  
Review all settings on the final page and click **Finish adding**.

## Done 🎉
That’s it — you have created your user in Microsoft 365.

The system will now create the user. If a license was assigned, a mailbox and OneDrive will also be created automatically.  
This can take a few minutes, after which the user account is ready to use.

If you are just getting started with Microsoft 365, this is one of the first things you’ll do — and luckily, it’s a simple one.
